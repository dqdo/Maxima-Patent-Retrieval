Current is supplied through a set of connection points of the parallel configuration with the variable power source to, thereby, create the motional current in the ultrasonic transducer and the motional current is regulated with a current controller by varying an output of the power source, thereby maintaining a substantially constant rate of movement of the cutting blade across a variety of cutting loads.</p>

The connected handle is detected and dependent upon the detected handle type a different one of the outputs are provided.</p>

          <p>A disposable ultrasonic surgical handle includes a disposable handle body defining a battery-holding compartment shaped to receive a battery therein and operable to couple a proximal end of an ultrasonic waveguide to an ultrasonic transducer therethrough. The body has a transducer dock exposed to the environment and interchangeably housing the transducer and a waveguide attachment dock shaped to align and attach the proximal end of the waveguide to the transducer and hold them at the body when the respectively docked at the transducer and attachment docks. A disposable driving-wave generation circuit in the handle body electrically contacts the battery and the transducer when the battery and the transducer are disposed respectively in the battery-holding compartment and the transducer dock. The circuit generates an output waveform sufficient to cause ultrasonic movement along the waveguide by exciting the transducer when the transducer is coupled to the waveguide.</p>

          <p>A disposable ultrasonic surgical handle includes a disposable handle body defining a battery-holding compartment shaped to receive a battery therein and operable to couple a proximal end of an ultrasonic waveguide to an ultrasonic transducer therethrough. The body has a transducer dock exposed to the environment and interchangeably housing the transducer and a waveguide attachment dock shaped to align and attach the proximal end of the waveguide to the transducer and hold them at the body when the respectively docked at the transducer and attachment docks. A disposable driving-wave generation circuit in the handle body electrically contacts the battery and the transducer when the battery and the transducer are disposed respectively in the battery-holding compartment and the transducer dock. The circuit generates an output waveform sufficient to cause ultrasonic movement along the waveguide by exciting the transducer when the transducer is coupled to the waveguide.</p>
